This project is in its very early stages and we encourage developer contributions.

Before submitting a PR, please do this checklist first:

- Run `make test` and fix any errors.
- When adding new functionality, also add tests for this functionality.
- Include references to any other relevant materials in your PR, such as AWS documentation.
